.Sh NAME
.Nm libchk
.Nd a tool to check shared library links
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hsv
.Op Fl x Ar directory
.Op Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to help users find out the following files:
.Bl -dash -column -compact -offset indent
.It
Executables that have unresolvable shared library links
.It
Shared libraries that are not referenced by any executables
.El
.Pp
Directories that
.Nm
searches for executables and libraries include:
.Bl -column -compact -offset indent
.It Pa /bin
.It Pa /sbin
.It Pa /usr/bin
.It Pa /usr/games
.It Pa /usr/libexec
.It Pa /usr/sbin
.It Pa $LOCALBASE/bin
.It Pa $LOCALBASE/lib
.It Pa $LOCALBASE/libexec
.It Pa $LOCALBASE/sbin
.It Pa $X11BASE/bin
.It Pa $X11BASE/lib
.It Pa $X11BASE/libexec
.It Pa $X11BASE/sbin
.El
.Pp
And the directories listed in
.Ev PATH ,
as well as the library search path that
.Xr ldconfig 8
tells.  In addition, a user can specify additional directories to
search via the command line.
.Pp
e.g.:
.Dl $ libchk /home/*/bin
.Pp
.Nm
recursively looks into those directories and checks shared library
links for each binary.  If a dead library link is found, it is
immediately reported.
.Pp
When it is done though all directories,
.Nm
lists the shared libraries in the library search path that are not
referenced by (linked with) any executables.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Pp
makes
.Nm
report it as well.
.Pp
.It Fl v
.It Fl -verbose
Make a detailed report.
.Nm
will also check and report what executables and libraries each library
is referenced (used) by.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar directory
.It Fl -exclude Ar directory
Exclude the specified directory from the list of directories that
.Nm
searches for executables and libraries.
.It Ar directory ...
Additional directories to search for binaries.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "LOCALBASE" -compact
.It Ev PATH
The command search path.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
The local base directory. (default:
.Pa /usr/local )
.It Ev X11BASE
The X11 base directory. (default:
.Pa /usr/X11R6 )
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ldconfig 8
.Sh BUGS
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
There is always a possibility that any library can be dynamically
linked with by calling
.Xr dlopen 3 ,
which
.Nm
can never detect.
.Pp
.It
Currently,
.Nm
only checks
.Fx
ELF executables and libraries.
